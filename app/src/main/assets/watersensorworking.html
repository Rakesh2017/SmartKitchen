			<center><i><b>WATER SENSOR</b></i></center>
			<p>
						Water sensor brick is desgined for water detection, which can be widely ued in sensing rainfall, water level and even liquid leakage. 
						Connecting a water sensor to an Arduino is a great way to detect a leak, spill, flood, rain etc. It can be used to detect the pressure,
						the level , the volume and the absense of water. While this could be used to remind you to water your plants,, therer is a better GROOVE
						SENSOR for that. The sensor has an array of exposed traces, which read LOW when water is detected.

			<center><b><i> HOW DOES IT WORK? </i></b></center>
			<p>
			<b><b>.</b></b>Ultrasonic sensors operate by transmitting sound waves that reflect from the liquid surface and are obtained by the sensor.
			The sensor measures the time interval between the transmitted and received signals, which is then converted into distance measurement with the 
			help of electronic circuits within the sensor thereby measuring the level of the liquid.

		<br><br>	<b><b>.</b></b>Float sensors work based on the change in resistance of a potentiometer within the sensor by the turning of a pulley or a spring-loaded shaft.

			<br><br><b><b>.</b></b>Bubbler sensors, on the other hand, measure water level by detecting the pressure of air-filled tubes with an open, submerged bottom end. 
			The static pressure at the end of the tubes is more when the water level is high, and therefore more air pressure is required to fill the tube.

			<><b><i> HOW WE ARE GOING TO USE IT IN OUR PROJECT? </i></b></center>
			
			<p>
				We need water for any kind of work in the kitchen whether it is related to cooking, washing(dishes, vegetables, fruits). Water is the essential source.
				But sometimes unnecessary wastage of water happens. Our motive is to stop this type of wastages as we know the shortage of water takes many lives each day.
				A water detector is an electronic device that is designed to detect the presence of water and provide an alert in time to allow the prevention of water damage.
