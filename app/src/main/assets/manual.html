<p>SMART KITCHEN</p>
<p>Our project is based on the internet of the thing(IOT). Our Vision is to use IOT in kitchen to reduce burdensome. We are mainly focused on three things. Keeping track of household things, which product is finished and which all are about to finish. To accomplish it, we will use UltraSonic Sensor, which will keep track of this all. Safety purpose. Smoke Sensor will also be used to detect smoke.Exhaust fan will be automatically turned on and you will also be notified via alert on mobile. Water overflow and usage. Water Sensor will be used to keep vigil eye on watr wastage due to water overflow. Message will be delivered to you on your mobile. All these Sensors will be Managed by Arduino Board(MicroController).</p>
<p>ARDUINO UNO</p>
<p>Arduino Uno is a MicroController board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins(of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog input, a 16MHZ quartz crystal,a USB connection,a power jack and a reset button. It contains eveything needed to support the microcontroller, simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. You can tinker with your UNO without worrying too much abut doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again,</p>
<p>Sensors Used</p>
<h5>1.ULTRASONIC SENSOR</h5>
<p>The ultrasonic sensor uses SONAR to determine distance to an object like bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package. From 2cm to 400cm or 1" to 13 feet. It operation is not affected by sunlight or black materials like Sharp rangefinders are(although acoustically soft materils like cloth can be difficult to detect). It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver module.</p>
<h5>2.SMOKE SENSOR</h5>
<p>The MQ-2 smoke sensor is sensitive to smoke and to the other flammable gases like (LPG, BUTANE, PROPANE, METHANE, ALCOHOL, HYDROGEN). The resistance of the sensor is different on the type of the gas. The smoke sensor has a built-in potentiometer that allow you toadjust the sensor sensitivity according to how accurate you want to detect gas.</p>
<h5>3.WATER SENSOR</h5>
<p>Water sensor brick is desgined for water detection, which can be widely ued in sensing rainfall, water level and even liquid leakage. Connecting a water sensor to an Arduino is a great way to detect a leak, spill, flood, rain etc. It can be used to detect the pressure, the level , the volume and the absense of water. While this could be used to remind you to water your plants,, therer is a better GROOVE SENSOR for that. The sensor has an array of exposed traces, which read LOW when water is detected.</p>
