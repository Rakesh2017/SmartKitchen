			<center><i><b>SMOKE SENSOR</b></i></center>
			<br> <br>
			The MQ-2 smoke sensor is sensitive to smoke and to the other flammable gases like:-<br><br>
	<b>  	1.> LPG     	</b>		<br>
	<b>		2.> BUTANE		</b>		<br>
	<b>		3.> PROPANE		</b>		<br>
	<b>		4.> METHANE		</b>		<br>
	<b>		5.> ALCOHOL		</b>		<br>
	<b>		6.> HYDROGEN	</b>		<br><br>
			The resistance of the sensor is different on the type of the gas. The smoke sensor has a built-in potentiometer that allow you toadjust 
			the sensor sensitivity according to how accurate you want to detect gas. <br>
			<br>
			<center> <i><b> HOW DOES IT WORK? </b></i></center> 
			
			<p> The voltage that the sensor outputs changes accordingly to the smoke/gas level that exists in the atmosphere. 
				The sensor outputs a voltage that is proportional to the concentration of smoke/gas. </p>
				
			<p> In other words, the relantionship between voltage and gas concentration is the following:- <br> <br>
				<b>.</b> The greater the gas concentration, the greater the output voltage. <br>
				<b>.</b> The lower the gas concentration, the lower the uutput voltage.

				<p> The MQ-2 also has a built-in potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity to smoke. By adjusting the potentiometer, you can change how 
					sensitive it is to smoke, so it's a form of calibrating it to adjust how much voltage it will put out in relation to the smoke it is exposed to.</p>
				
				The output can be an analog signal (A0) tthat can be read with an analog input of the Arduino or a digital output (D0) 
				that can be read with a digital input of the Arduino. </p> <br> <br>
			
			<center><b><i> HOW WE ARE GOING TO USE IT IN OUR PROJECT? </i></b></center>
			<p> All kitchens are equipped with <b>LPG</b> or <b>PROPANE</b> gas cylinders. These gases are highly inflammable and if gas leaked can cause serious fires.
				And our main motive is to detect the same, so that quick action can be taken to eradicate any mishap. As soon as the <b>MQ2</b> Smoke sensor will
				sense the gas, arduino will immediately  starts the exhauts fan and message will also be delivered to your mobile phone about the gas leak.</p>
